## Introduction

Welcome to Range Mapper, a repository that allows researchers, web developers, students and other users to extract taxa-specific, spatio-temporal data from the Neotoma Paleoecology Database Collective [@williams2017neotoma]. This code also establishes a channel between Neotoma and Carto, an online mapping platform where Neotoma data can be visualized and transformed through [Carto's user interface](https://carto.com/attribution/). (NOTE FOR ADRIAN-- how/what do we site here? Is this what's happening?).  branch structure @Anna?

### Required Files and Services
We used R to perform our Neotoma Query and to sort the data we retrieved. If R is not installed on your machine, you may download the latest version [here](https://www.r-project.org/). An RMD filed [here](link) will provide a step-by-step guide to the rest of our R code. 

We used CARTO VL to map this data. You will need to create a CARTO account to create maps of your own. You can do so [here](https://carto.com/), but we reccomend you check with your institution first to see if it has any use agreements with this platform.
